- Address (Multiline Textarea)
- Company Name (Text Input)
- Email Address (Email Input)
- Department (Dropdown with options: HR, Sales, Development, Marketing, Others)
- Gender (Radio Buttons: Male, Female, Prefer not to say)

## Design Elements
- Different background colors for the page and form
- Minimalistic box-shadow on the form container
- Hover effect on the submit button
- Consistent styling across all form elements
- Proper spacing and alignment

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
3. Fill out the form fields
4. Click the Submit button

## File Structure
- `index.html` - Contains the HTML structure of the form
- `styles.css` - Contains all the styling for the form
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## Browser Compatibility
This form works in all modern browsers that support HTML5 and CSS3, including:
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge

## Notes
- Since this is a static HTML form with no backend, the form data will not be submitted anywhere when the Submit button is clicked.
- To connect this form to a backend service, you would need to add a form action and potentially some JavaScript for handling submissions.
